    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Unlike other Lùshŭs, she requires a certain medium to cast her skill. The Shape of Will. This is also why people did not recognize her. She's harder to identify."

  },

    "english_dialogue": "...! How did you know my ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Wait, you mean you can red people through their bones? That makes no sense. What can one's physical condition tell you?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Many. Many stories, many sounds. Even if I was never there with them."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Such as you. The markings on your bones resemble an open net, yet it captures nothing. You are away from the waterless land where you once lived, and to this day you're still wandering."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The girl's eyes widen with astonished disbelief."
  },

  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What on earth are you talking about ..."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Have I mistaken anything? I should hope not."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Forgive me. I have long since stopped reading others' bones and put them into words."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Perhaps I did not tell it in the most precise way, but it should be generally accurate."

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Alright, stop."

  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },

    "english_speaker": "Zhuye the Monster",
    "english_dialogue": "Squeak!!"

  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "*sighs* These stupid birds!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Following closely behind is a mysterious creature markedly different from other feathered balls."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "This one is shining bright! Get out of my way, out!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "It is indeed exceptionally bright and long, illuminating the shallow stream in front of them on both sides."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Gĕtiān stares in the direction the scattered Zhúyè ran off, his mind burdened with thought."
  },
  {

    "english_dialogue": "Have you drunk the liquor ... offered by Jiŭ Niángzĭ?"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "No, but I had the water from her. Why?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "These Zhúyè might be attracted here by the scent of liquor. They feed on the flowers of Zhúyè, which can be used to make liquor and smell of lees."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "They could be here because they smelt the liquor. But you only had the water. What else could attract them?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei thinks back to the preceding events."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "If they were attracted by the scent of liquor, I think it was the wooden dolls' fault. They soaked themselves in the liquor before they attacked me. I might have gotten their scent during the battle."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "The scent of liquor stains is not strong enough to attract them here. It would have taken a proper consumption of liquor for them to notice."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "I worry that liquor is the medium for her transformation skill, but that is only my speculation. If the water you drank also exerts the same effect on you ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "As though his words hold the power of execution, the change happens the very moment he speaks."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Emm ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "What? You ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei kneels down and her body transforms, just as her companions transformed on the steppes before her."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "How so ...!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Although Gĕtiān had already anticipated this moment, he cannot help but be startled by this strange process and flaps his wings involuntarily."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "His instincts tell him to flee."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Night falls. The rain has stopped, and the riverbank is moist and soft."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Not a horse, but a foal. Look carefully. The footsteps are smaller and shallower than a horse's."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Where are the ends of the tracks?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Guard",

    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "That can't be."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Făcáo strides over to inspect the traces near where the trail of footprints ends."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Guard",
    "english_dialogue": "It rained a couple of times. The rain could have washed away the footprints."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "If that's the case, there shouldn't be other tracks here."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Like this. A bird's claw marks at the edge of the rotten wood."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "It was a bird of prey. And judging from the size and the sharpness, it's quite strong."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Guard",
    "english_dialogue": "It's true ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Guard",
    "english_dialogue": "Hey, I found another two sets of footprints!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Guard",
    "english_dialogue": "They are shallow and narrow, possibly from the same person, a young woman."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "The wood lies on the ground near the river. It's not a good spot for birds of prey to roost on."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "What stopped here was something even bigger."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "A young woman met a huge bird of prey here, yet there is no bloodstain at all."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Perhaps the truth behind the foreign merchant's disappearances is different from the feather man's statements."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "We need to go back to the Zhící."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Getian",

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "I have thought about it, given that my wand was also left in that tavern. But should I return, Jiŭ Niángzĭ might be alerted."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "I sense kindness in that girl. She hasn't done anything evil except for turning people into Lùshŭs. Your friend should be safe with her for the moment."
  },

  },

  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Is that really needed?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",

    "english_dialogue": "All in all, you must take me with you. My arcane skill will vindicate you."
