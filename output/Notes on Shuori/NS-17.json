  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "From my perspective, Jiŭ Niángzĭ is not a bad person. I think she did all these things for a reason—some kind of burden only known to herself."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "That being said, the two of them fall into a shared silence. Since entering the city, the dark cloud of their uncertain future has followed them like a shadow."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Well, there's no easy answer to any question here. We should meet with Mr. Gĕtiān before making any further arrangements."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Sure."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The woman and the Lùshŭ walk forward at pace."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The two increase their speed, arriving outside the gray walls of the Zhící courtyard before they might be discovered by another team of night patrollers."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The streets in this area are built with high walls surrounding their homes on all sides, so that people walking by can see nothing but stacked bricks."

    "english_dialogue": "Stop here. I hear ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "It is at this moment that Gĕtiān flies over the Zhící courtyard's walls."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "His wings flutter lighter—lighter than the previous few times, and he has no intention of stopping until he notices the figure at the foot of the wall."

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Mr. Gĕtiān?"

    "english_dialogue": "Or perhaps, he had no intention of staying until he heard Bessmert's voice."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "It's you?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Gĕtiān perches on a tree by the roadside, tightly clutching branches bearing leaves that have only just begun to wither. The tree's shadow sways. But he goes silent, only stopping as he recognizes the two figures below."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The ground nearby is flat and long dried. Without a puddle, Yenisei can only grab hold of Bessmert's hem an tug on it lightly to confirm her guess."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert, though, quickly understands. She listens to the sound and walks forward and to one side, eagerly reaching around beneath the tree."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Mr. Gĕtiān ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",

  },

  },

    "english_dialogue": "Leaving? Are you going after her?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "No. I was not meant to be here in the first place. It's only natural that I should return to the mountain."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Return? But we're not done with Jiŭ Niángzĭ yet. Yenisei and the others are still in the shape of Lùshŭ ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "She was turned into a Lùshŭ in front of you. Are you going to just let her be?"

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "She has told you everything."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes, she did! Now you're the only one who can persuade others to go after Jiŭ Niángzĭ ... We are foreigners here. People won't listen to us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "I am left with no other options. Today, at the Zhící, none of us would have gotten away if I hadn't surrendered."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "This is a fact that, as an observer of the entire scene, Yenisei cannot deny."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "They will only see me as a greater threat if I insist on raising doubts about her."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "They have known her for a long time but know nothing about me. My words have no greater effect than yours, for I'm also ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "A foreigner here."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "His voice is light, but as gloomy as night."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Still, you're going to just give it all up before exhausting every possible way to end this?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A wave of swaying tree shadows causes Gĕtiān to fly up on alert. He seems to have finally made up his mind to leave."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "You need not prick my pride. Gĕtiāns and Mièméngs are never meant to get involved in this."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Before a response is issued, the sound of rhythmic footsteps sounds, one after another."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Whether it is the patrol or some other city personnel, it is enough to immediately alert the vigilant trio."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "...!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Gĕtiān though, does not leave. His actions are seemingly not in line with his tongue."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "There are people coming. You ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "???",
    "english_dialogue": "I knew it."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A bold and imposing voice sounds out from the spot the footsteps had been moving forward."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "You two are in it together. The merchant identity was only an excuse you made up to enter the city."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Isn't that so?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No, please listen to me ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "The stories you told Lǐzhèng made no sense at all. How dare you come back like you did nothing and break into the jail?!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "You go first."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Mr. Gĕtiān!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert intuits that she shouldn't just run away. At that moment, the only one who can help her confirm her assumption is Gĕtiān."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The one being sought for help does not make a sound. He dives from the tree, spreading his wings to cast an immense shadow over the scene."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "He flies between the patrol and Bessmert, turning his back to them, then spreads his wings even wider until they completely bock the view of those behind him."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "At this moment, he truly seems like a bird of prey."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Lùshŭs are fleet-footed creatures. Get on her back and leave. I will join you shortly."

    "english_dialogue": "Go!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Don't you run! Catch them!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },

    "english_dialogue": "At this moment, the night seems to have become even darker, without a single star to light the sky, and only faint moonlight trails scattered across the riverbank."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "It's been quite a while. Is he ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei cannot help but think of Gĕtiān's experience at the Zhícíthat same morning."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Have faith in him, child. He is able to defend himself, since he managed to escape without others' help."

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "I believe ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "I believe he is not aggressive. He left his wand behind when he tried to save you."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A long period of waiting, pregnant with anxiety, is finally broken by the sound of flapping wings."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "...!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Madam!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Gĕtiān crosses over them and stops along the twisted vines, folding his wings and tightly gripping the edges of the tree with his talons."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The garment on his head must have split during his fight, and now fully reveals his previously covered expression, one both baffled and tense."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "You're here!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "You seem fine. Do you still intend to leave? Or, have you changed your mind?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert follows the sound of movement, turning her head toward where Gĕtiān landed."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "No. I'm here for one last thing."
  },
  {

    "english_dialogue": "I'll take the opportunity and get those half Lùshŭs out of there."

    "english_dialogue": "Yes?"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We're not going anywhere. We must release them from the arcane skill and bring them back."

    "english_dialogue": "Though her true intention is beyond my speculation, I fear the consequences of her action will be severe."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "You know full well the consequences."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Mm? Certainly."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "But you won't help us stop her."

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "That is not my problem to address. I have done my part."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Then why did you help us get rid of the soldiers and offer to help again?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "This question surprises Gĕtiān. He had never thought about it until that moment. He lights his wings, forming a posture similar to cupping his face, sinking into contemplation."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "After a moment, he conjures up an explanation."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "It doesn't suggest my further involvement in this matter."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "You are contradicting your own words, Sir."

    "english_dialogue": "Very well. I will put it differently. Look at the street. It is empty tonight."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "There was a time when people sent lanterns down the river on New Year's Eve. Even the simplest lantern would glow like the moon on the water."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Those lanterns, carrying people's wishes, floated down the river. The further they went, the more wishes were granted."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Some would cast arcane skills on their lanterns to keep them from getting wet. But most of the lanterns still disappeared in the depths of the mountains or at the waterfalls."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "I used to look down at the city from the mountain top, watching those lanterns float down the streams and merge into a light belt in the dark."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "They were more brilliant and vibrant than the bonfires that were lit up all night in this city."
  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "This sad reality of the present makes it difficult to imagine the scene described in Gĕtiān's words, despite the nostalgia overflowing from his tone."

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei, who has been silent on one side for a long time, seems to understand his feelings. And so she continues to remain silent, only looking at the pitch-black surface of the river."

    "english_dialogue": "The river too looks back with its own quieting babble."

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Mm? What is she doing?"

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Of course, Bessmert can also hear the sound of her entering the water, but she only shakes her head."

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The water begins to engulf half of Yenisei's body. At the same time, her song begins."

  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "What is this?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Colorful dots of light suddenly ignited in the narrow river in front of them, burning like intense flames along the water's surface."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Then, the dots of light meandered to the soft riverbank, drifting with the song, like travelers on the long river, journeying without end."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The place where the light passes through now shines brighter than all the decorations in the city streets, more than many years worth of river lanterns that had passed through the mountains."

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "There are river lanterns, yes? I can't see them, but I can feel the light."

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "I ... don't ..."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Faced with such a scene, Gĕtiān is struck dumb. He can sense Yenisei's arcanist origins in her bones, but he cannot even begin to imagine what is happening at this moment."

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Mr. Gĕtiān ..."
  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "They float in your mind, glistening like the river lanterns."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "And you're saddened by the idea that they will be gone one day, like the lanterns drifting away from your sight."
