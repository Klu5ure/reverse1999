    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

    "english_dialogue": "What? No ..."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert makes a move before Yenisei finishes speaking. She pats the girl's back and gestures for her to allow her to explain."

    "english_dialogue": "Despite her doubts, the girl habitually follows her lead."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",

  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei is almost certain that her companion is winking at her, despite her eyes being covered."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Or perhaps it is just her own intuition prompting her. She realizes then, in a moment of enlightenment, that in their precarious situation, she may well need to learn how to quickly accommodate these occasional lies."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "Hmm?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",

  },

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "But the servant is not here today ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Alright, you can tell me, and I'll write it down. Like ... this one. What did you come to the city for?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "For business."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "This is also what we are trying to find out."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "On our way here, they were transformed into \"horses\" and taken away by a giant bird."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Transformed into horses? Um ... Then how come you didn't get transformed?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "We have no idea. Perhaps because Madam Bessmert and I are arcanists, while the others are humans."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "What do you mean?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Does the giant bird only attack humans? Then how does he identify them?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "There is no huge difference between humans and arcanists, after all."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What? Emm ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No huge difference?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "This is an answer they had never considered before."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Or rather, it was a premise that seemed so distant to their own views that it defied being considered."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "As if saying a diamond was no different from a clump of soil."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Is that a problem?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No, not at all."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Let's go back to the difference between humans and arcanists later."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "My guess is, there might be something wrong with the water."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We found a river when crossing the steppe. Our teammates were too thirsty and drank the water in haste. Then we realized something was wrong."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes. It came from the northwest. Not a big one, but quite clean."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "That might be the main river of Pèi City, called Pèilín River."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "But it has been shrinking these past years. Also, there are no cases of people drinking it and turning into horses ... What were the features of that giant bird?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "He has black or brown wings, red tail feathers, and a man's face."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Also, as I recall it, he has the voice of a young man."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "A giant bird with a man's face. A feather man. Did he play a musical instrument?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "He played a stick-like instrument. His music could lead the horses to where he went."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Was there a bone-like wand with him?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Could be, but I'm not sure. He was so far away from us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "I have a rough idea now."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "If that's what I think it is, even though he is not a Xiángruì, I have to say ... *sighs*"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "He seems to be overcome with regret."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert demurely adjusts her kneeling position, keenly sensing a new development."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Sounds like something happened when you last met."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "The giant bird, or the feather man, as we say, was considered the Xiángruì by some citizens. It is because he looks like the legendary Gōumáng."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What is this Xiángruì? Is it some kind of guardian?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Not exactly. In most cases, Xiángruì is just Yāo, but in the good way. They are benevolent, using their power to help people and bless the land."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Before your report, there was someone else witnessing a feather man with a bone wand. He once brought some animals to the Zhící and claimed they were transformed from humans."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "This ... this is exactly what happened to our teammates."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "If these two are the same feather man, then he is very likely involved in these missing persons cases."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, the cases you mentioned ... I see."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Too bad, that witness couldn't remember anything, even the slightest feature, for us to draw picture. Since no one could provide other evidence, her word was considered nonsense."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "The Făcáo thought she was \"possessed\" and suggested she take a break in her hometown during the holiday."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We want to pay her a visit. Will she come back?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Lǐzhèng waves his hand. There is little value to be gleamed from such a faulty clue."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "I'm afraid not. She worked as the Zhílǐ in the Zhící. It's not a crucial position, but clearly not suitable for a possessed person. There is someone filling in for her now."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei grips the fabric on her knee. She is as persistent as a soldier when executing orders, and this time is no different."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What if ... What if I can offer a drawing of the feather man?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "He was far away in mid-air at the time. I couldn't see the details, but I remember his outline and the color of his wings. Besides, I have experience in making sketches and maps."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I can totally make a drawing of him."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Sketch? Map? Hmm ... But we can only attack your drawing to the wanted poster for the moment. We can't put him in prison without solid evidence. Everything is yet to be confirmed by the court."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "But a drawing is better than nothing. Please give it a try."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Here is the brush and the ink. Help yourself."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei approaches the table and picks up the brush that was used to write just moments ago."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "This is the same long pen you just used?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "That's right."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "And this is ... the ink? But it won't adhere to the pen."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "To get the liquid ink, you need to rub the ink stick on the ink stone first. It's fine. I'll rub it for you. You can focus on the drawing."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The old man rolls up his sleeves and deftly grinds out some ink for Yenisei to dip the brush in."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "And the girl does not hesitate to write—"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Huh? The lines it draws are really heavy ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "And do we only have the black ink?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "No, there are different colors."

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "May I have the red one?"

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
