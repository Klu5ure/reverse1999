  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Why not enough? He left his bone wand, which means he was here before. And your friend is missing! Still not enough to prove his guilt?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "But only Yenisei knows what the giant bird looks like. She also drew the picture of that bird."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "Without her, we cannot confirm that the feather man and the giant bird are the same creature."
  },
