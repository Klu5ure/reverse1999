    "english_dialogue": "The Lùshŭ silently approaches and leans against her tightly."

    "english_dialogue": "It's the first day of a new year and the first day of spring."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Lìchūn, the beginning of spring, corresponds to the lower trigram of Kăn in the direction of Gèn. It is the season of life."

  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Suìzhāochūn is how people would call it when the first day of the Dùshuò Festival and the first day of spring happen to be the same day. It is a once-in-a-century good sign."

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Indeed. It's also the first day of a new year. I like the coincidence."

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "She listens without intending any comment."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "It all began with the unstoppable flood. At first, it was just a few unusual tides that no one noticed."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Then the flood came, followed by the destruction of the bridge."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "The temple on the mountain thus lost its connection to its pilgrims. The prayers were no longer answered."

    "english_dialogue": "And now ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Is it the eternal fate of humans and arcanists to act upon desires they know cannot be realized?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "It's useless. The god won't hear us, nor will It see us."
