    "english_dialogue": "And here are two festoons with auspicious deer patterns. Not a fancy kind, but I made the pattern myself. Put it on the wall if you want. It would look as lovely as the horse paper-cutouts you gave me last year."

    "english_dialogue": "A toast."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Right. A toast! But I can't do it myself, so I copied a line from the book at the place where I work now. I like how it sounds!"

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Hope I didn't pronounce it wrong. It means ... people should drink, and drink more, so you shouldn't say not to it!"

    "english_dialogue": "The crowd loosens up once again shortly after he finishes speaking, the sound of clinking cups and tapping chopsticks continuing to rise and fall."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen IV",
    "english_dialogue": "You did a good job with the toast, Jiŭ Niángzĭ. Looks like you've learned something from those love poems. You must have read them unconsciously after you stuck them on the wall ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, please, that custom is no longer popular in our neighborhood!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "I'd rather transfer the poem onto a kerchief and make a purse out of it, just like Jiŭ Niángzĭ did. It draws so much attention on the street!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Actually, I still can't read what they write on the purse. But the characters seem beautiful!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen V",
    "english_dialogue": "What about the one you recited during the toast? You sounded really fluent. Who taught that to you?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, haha, that's from the former Zhílǐ, the one who went back to her hometown. She taught me that."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen III",
    "english_dialogue": "Speaking of her, is she going to come back?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "I didn't know any better ... But by now, she should be at home, having New Year's Eve dinner."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "Did you hear from her? If she doesn't come back, you'll have to work as the official Zhílǐ. Who will take care of the tavern by then?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "The tavern has never had a reliable owner before you. It would have still been run down if you hadn't taken over it."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ is kind and warm-hearted. Such a girl of integrity can perform well in both running a tavern and being a Zhílǐ."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "You have a high regard for her, Lǐzhèng. Are you telling the truth or showing partiality?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "The truth, of course. What she said in the Zhící a few hours ago is still vivid in my mind."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "I once again realized that it's never too late to learn."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "No, no, no, I'm not as good as you say."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "What did she say?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Things like \"One can remove the footsteps, but not the path one walketh on,\" \"Act not against the nature of thy flesh, for through it all things were made.\" ... She made it sound easy."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The crowd erupts in a series of alarmed cries."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen V",
    "english_dialogue": "Really?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Absolutely. She is indeed illiterate, but she keeps learning and interprets the classic sayings in her own way."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Even if there were other scholars, they would be convinced by her powerful speech. Sadly, the one she confronted was not a human but a Yāo."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "Confronted a Yāo in the Zhící ... Was that the feather man?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "She thought the feather man was Xiángruì and asked him some questions."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen V",
    "english_dialogue": "You actually asked him questions?! He could have turned you into another striped horse!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Um, I didn't think of that back then ... This is the first time I've ever been so close to a Yāo. He looks so similar to the ones in the books! So I ..."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The rapid sound of footsteps approaches, and their leader's figure steps into the tavern in several broad and forceful steps."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The abrupt sound severs the excitement in the courtyard."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",

    "english_dialogue": "Here, I'm here! What's happening?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Turns out those foreign ladies have been in league with Gĕtiān the whole time. They helped him break out of jail and hid themselves in the wild with their arcane skills."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "I'm sure it will rain again soon and it will be dangerous to stay in the wild. By then, they will come to you."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Because you are the feather man's target."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "In the courtyard, the crowd's gaze follows Făcáo closely, while Făcáo's own eyes are fixed on Jiŭ Niángzĭ. They realize now that some word of resistance is on her tongue."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "What ... Jiŭ Niángzĭ, you ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "You must leave here. You can't stay in the tavern."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "But it's-it's my tavern! Why am I leaving my own place?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "You are in danger. Since Gĕtiān was able to break out of jail, he'll for sure be able to break into the Zhící. For your safety, I will have my soldiers escort you to the government office."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "That's the only safe place now."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "No, I'm not leaving. He is neither a Xiángruì nor a strong Yāo ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Why are we afraid of him?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The sound of wings cutting through the air overlaps the end of Jiŭ Niángzĭ's question."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The new arrival spreads his wings, like a dark cloud blanketing the courtyard's colorful decorations and dazzling lights."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen III",
    "english_dialogue": "Watch out!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",

    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "She's right."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "You need not fear me. This lady owner of the tavern is the bigger concern here."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Formation One!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The well-trained guards surround the tavern, and the sound of running, tramping feet echoes through the courtyard."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "I knew you would come for her."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Facao",
    "english_dialogue": "Where are your accomplices? Are you the vanguard of the team?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ, it's not too late for you to stop."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "No more turning people into a Lùshŭ. Too many people have gone missing because of you."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "This information, unknown present, hits like a stone cast into water."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen V",

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
