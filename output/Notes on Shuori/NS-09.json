    "english_speaker": "Citizen II",
    "english_dialogue": "Haha, you must have been distracted by the Storyteller, huh? He was telling the end of the story today, so you would never miss it."

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "He speaks with eloquence, as if possessing some strange magic that naturally attracts even those who didn't go there to hear him."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "It was the seventh year of his reign. Yáo granted an audience to an envoy offering a treasure from the Jiéxiōng Kingdom. The envoy had a strange face and a bulgy chest. He claimed to have come from somewhere millions of miles away from the Yúmén Pass."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Then Yáo and his people saw a real giant bird. It was as huge as a mountain and as dazzling as a phoenix. It had an azure body and red tail feathers!"

  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen II",
    "english_dialogue": "Was it really a phoenix?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh no, no. The bird was called Mièméng. It was said to be able to read one's bones, change their fate, and even remove misfortune."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Yáo was pleased with the gift and kept the bird in Dùshuò Mountain. Naturally, that very bird was the ancestor of all the Mièméngs nowadays."

    "english_dialogue": "H-have you seen a Mièméng with your own eyes?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Be patient and listen. Mièméngs tend to inhabit silent and clean environments, so since the ancient times, the people have always cleaned their yards carefully from time to time, hoping the Xiángruìs will gather and stay beside them. It may not work immediately, but it makes things possible in the long term."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen III",
    "english_dialogue": "So that's why we have the tradition of cleaning the yards on Shuòri?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Exactly. Some even make Mièméng statues with jewelry and use them to decorate their homes, hoping the Mièméngs will bless the family. Remember the \"chicken\" statues on your roof? Actually, they are not chickens but Mièméngs, so are those birds you see in the paper-cutouts on the doors."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "After saying this, he lifts a piece of red paper, carved in the shape of a peculiarly familiar bird."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Look, everyone. This is the Mièméng."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The crowd expresses an underwhelmed disappointment."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Hmm. But this looks like a normal chicken ..."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "More like a capercaillie to me."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "And like the bird I just drew, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "The way he is speaking is interesting, rhythmic, like singing. It would be great if there was some music to accompany him. Something is missing in his story without music."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "If he could ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Before Bessmert can finish speaking, the red paper instantly ignites in the hands of the Storyteller, and before touching his fingers, it becomes ashes and falls onto the stone platform."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The little boy standing beside him stands on his tiptoes, quickly taking the initiative to sweep the ashes into the charcoal pot below."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Storyteller",
    "english_dialogue": "Among the Five Elements, Mièméng belongs to the Fire. That's why people set fire in spring to drive away misfortunes. Speaking of ..."

  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What is this noise?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "It seems no one cares about the noise of the cracker. Only Jiŭ Niángzĭ, who had previously worked so hard to restore order to the bustling city, turns around with the two of them."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "As she turns around, she seems to remember something and shows a remorseful look."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "The cracker ... Shoot. I almost forgot!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Not drinks, but other stuff! Oh, and \"drinks on the house\" tomorrow!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Everyone chuckles warmly, making way for Jiŭ Niángzĭ. Yenisei holds onto Bessmert to prevent her from falling behind."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "This time, they follow her without incident. Despite the strangers' otherwise eye-catching hair, everyone's attention seems focused intently on the Storyteller telling the legend."
