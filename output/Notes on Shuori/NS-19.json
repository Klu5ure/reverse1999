    "english_dialogue": "This static courtyard is like a frozen scene, and Bessmert is the only actor walking freely on stage."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "This may be he reason why she is in pain. A seal powerful enough to change one's markings on the bones is not to be easily broken."
