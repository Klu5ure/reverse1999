  {
    "english_speaker": "Jurien",

    "english_dialogue": "Wait. About the date, we can only decide after making an inventory."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "You have 30 minutes."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "That's enough."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A brief consensus is reached, and the others scatter back to their former places, gathering supply boxes together and waiting for a response from the two in charge."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert cautiously touches the wooden boxes. The young girl comes to her side with a pen and paper, making a quiet record of things."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "For a moment, the only sound between them is of pen on paper."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "You know ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Hmm?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Mr. Jurien is very interested in arcanum and arcanists. He is the keenest supporter of our journey, besides the governor."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Even if his understanding of Ask and Acquire is significantly different from mine ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The girl continues her rummaging and recording, while responding gently and deftly to Bessmert's habitual broaching of this parallel topic."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "The legend of Ask and Acquire, as told by many merchants, always involves a certain price. The price takes different forms in the stories, but mostly it is a great danger."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I believe that refers to \"the highest mountain and deepest canyon\" in those stories."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "I reckon so. But Mr. Jurien, as a human historian studying the arcane skill, believes it's a form fo exchange that arcanists make with nature ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Mm-hmm. And you think he's wrong?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "At this stage, we can't verify anything, so all these assumptions will have to remain assumptions. However, as we are getting closer to that mysterious land, my craving for its knowledge is also becoming stronger."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Between these words, Bessmert walks around to another box and notices that the closer the instrument is placed to it, the more distinctly she can smell the alcohol."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "It is obvious that the alcohol prepared for boiling point measurements had been used as an \"emergency resource\" during the night when the temperature dropped drastically."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "We shouldn't ask too much from such a ragtag team."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What do we know about the supplies?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Put aside the water problem, the supplies can feed everyone for eight days, maybe twelve if we economize. We can hold even longer if there are any preys or herders along the way."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Are there any supply stations?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Our supply stations are not on these plains, at least not on the map."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "How much drinking water and alcohol do we have left?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Approximately ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, great. These idiots put water in the alcohol. Now we are short of both."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "At least the alcohol has kept them warm."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "They could have just drunk the alcohol."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Alright, alright, child. Now we should focus on the direction for the next step, not these bits of trivia."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Regarding which, just to be clear, what I have in mind is only slightly better than nothing."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Better how?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "The moist air and the soil. Have you noticed? The soil beneath our feet is way too sticky, even for a land after a thunderstorm."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "I'm not entirely sure about this ... But I tend to think that there is groundwater beneath us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Which means we are close to running water."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Alright. Let me think about how to get us there."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Can't you use your arcane skill?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What?! Just because you don't know what to do doesn't mean you should count on this thing. You are not like them!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "I just want to make use of everything we have ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Fine. I told you how it works. Without new running water, the old samples in the bottles can only show us the way back. That's the best they can do."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "To prove this, the girl takes a glass bottle from her person and places it in the waiting, doubtful hand."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "This one is from the lower course of the Om River. The arcane energy I can use for divination has almost faded away."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Can it show us the way back? Sure, but that's not what we want. Only Mr. Krolik and his men would be happy to hear that."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Upon hearing this, Bessmert stands up straight. Although she cannot see her eyes, her silent posture alone seems to affect an aura of rapid thought."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei looks up at her and can almost hear the sound of gears spinning in her skull."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "To think on the bright side, we still have a chance to go home."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "But I didn't leave my homeland to go back there, Madam."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes, yes, I know. I feel the same. I'm not suggesting we turn back immediately. It's just an option."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "To the best of my recollection, such moist soil is often found in the mountains and floodplains of the temperate zone, especially in the forest steppes covered with chernozem. The landscape is very different from where we are now."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Before we sheltered from the thunderstorm, you told me about a mountain in the southeast. It blocked the horizon from our sight, right?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The girl's eyes widen upon hearing these words—the expression of a hopeful epiphany."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Based on this, I would assume, the thunderstorm was the result of a stronger convection coming from the other side of the mountain. Now, on the steppe, to form a cloud large enough to bring a thunderstorm would require a large amount of running water ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "And the source of the running water is probably on the other side of the mountain!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Exactly ... We can set off in that general direction."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We might not find any water there. That's the worst result. In that case, we can still return here with the help of your arcane skill."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "As long as we have that glass bottle with us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "That's right."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We tell them we need another five days ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert grips the glass bottle in her hand as though clinging on to one final trace of hope."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "They won't accept more days than that. If they won't even settle for this, I will convince them, like I did when I first got them on the team."
