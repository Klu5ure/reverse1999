    "english_dialogue": "We do have a Pass, but it seems it doesn't work here."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "Well, just an understandable mistake for people from afar."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We all heard of the legend about it."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Uh, \"tribe\"? We are not tribal people. We come from the North."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Northerners? Oh, I mistook you for the descendants of the Wūsūn from the westward."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "It is said that they have migrated outside of the Zhéluómàn Mountain. No one has ever met them until now. Your clothes also have a unique style. I should apologize for my mistake."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "I could only imagine how hard it was for you to arrive here. Well done."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "However, forgive me for being offensive. It seems you have lost sight in both eyes ...?"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes. Would that be a problem?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Under this city's caring policy, you have the privilege of traveling without a Pass."

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "The gate guard is new here. I sincerely apologize for his offense."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "He bows slightly, implying a subtle apology, and leads the two toward the city proper."

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Come, follow me. It's not safe to stay outside of the city."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "There have been many missing persons cases recently. We intensified the patrol, in case someone is blocked out of the city and goes missing."

    "english_dialogue": "Missing persons cases ..."
