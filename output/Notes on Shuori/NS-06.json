    "english_dialogue": "No, you don't understand. Those yellow walls and the gates don't look real at all!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I've never seen any buildings like this. Pavilion on the stone walls with four pointy tips around the roof. They seem to be flying in the mid-air ..."
  },

  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert quietly turns her face toward Yenisei. Even though the girl knows her eyes are covered by fabric and are unable to see a thing, this gesture still possesses the power of a gaze."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A kind of soothing, stable, but at the same time questioning power."
  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "But there are guards patrolling around. They are holding some spear-like weapons, and the one in the front looks ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Quite different from us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I don't think they understand our language, even if we ask them o let us in ... Remember those herders? Almost impossible to communicate with them without an interpreter!"
