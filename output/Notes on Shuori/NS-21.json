  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Just like the good sir waiting behind us."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Gĕtiān remains in the tree and thus sees everything."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "His wings have become damp and heavy from the rain, and the cloth on his head is soaked, pressing down heavily as if dragging him back down to the ground, back into the mud, back to the place where the world began."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "He doesn't move, silently taking stock of everything had happened under that tree."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I see. If they are here for The Divination ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I will help."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "There are many puddles on the uneven ground. After a brief flicker of light, faces begin to appear in the water."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "They fade again one by one, forming in long or short sentences. Though Yenisei cannot understand them. This is all she can do."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "She continues to look for a while, then forces herself to turn around and search for Bessmert."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "Madam, after we go back ..."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert smiles, shakes her head gently, and halts the girl's words."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert turns around, seeming to be facing Gĕtiān's direction, back to the city gates from which everyone came."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "She can sense a steady stream of energy flowing toward some destination."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "You're wrong. \"It\" can hear us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Gĕtiān is in the tree, shaking off his wings like a swallow—shaking off the reasons for making him feel so excessively damp."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "He knows that Bessmert must not be talking to him, as the blind arcanist continues to work in vain."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "But then he is wrong yet again."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Getian",
    "english_dialogue": "Who is ... that?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The sound everyone present can hear becomes louder and louder against the breaking silence, accompanied now by nothing but the patter of the rain, to the point where they all turn back in response—"

    "english_dialogue": "All they see is a red dress swiftly passing over them all."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Why did she do it? Did she really jump over the broken bridge? WHat could possibly have happened to her after doing so?"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A myriad of questions hovers in the minds of the confounded witnesses."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "In shock, someone hurriedly pokes their head toward the opposite bank of the broken bridge, but stops and withdraws at the cliff's edge."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "They are seeking a definite answer, but fear the steepness and height of the cliff. Naturally, they never imagined someone might cross it—"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Citizen I",
    "english_dialogue": "This ... That ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",

    "english_dialogue": "The river! Ah, the Pèilín River is rising!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Beneath the cliff no longer lies a canyon or a low river, but a constantly rising torrent."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Citizen V",
    "english_dialogue": "Wait, I can talk! My body is ... What's happening?!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The people finally react."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "They look at each other excitedly, a red light illuminating their faces like the dazzling courtyard fires beneath the festival walkways—or the strip of light that appeared on the river before."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Their divine wishes have been granted."

    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ ... She jumped over the bridge! She jumped over ... in the human form!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "She didn't fall! I'm not sure if I saw it clearly ... I think, for an instant, she turned into a real Lùshŭ."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Is this the power of The Divination, the magic of \"Ask and Acquire\"?"
