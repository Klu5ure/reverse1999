    "english_speaker": "Krolik",

  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Team Member II",
    "english_dialogue": "Haven't you noticed the rocks around us? Their color is abnormal. I've never seen anything like this, not even in books ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Team Member II",
    "english_dialogue": "And look at the holes in the rocks! They were made by water erosion! And that's not supposed to happen in this climate!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Calm down, Sir. Perhaps we have reached somewhere beyond other adventurers' records, but that's all ..."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "But these flowers wither almost immediately after blooming. It would be difficult to describe such a scene as anything less than a miracle or a curse."

    "english_dialogue": "What? This is ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What is it? Explain what?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I don't know what species it is. It looks like a mini sunflower, but ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "Told you we should head back. Something's wrong with this dump."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Team Member I",

    "english_dialogue": "It's just a flower, yes? Why are you all so scared? I can't see, but ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert reaches out to grasp the flowers again, but the petals wither beneath her fingertips. Now more puzzled, she tries touching a complete cluster, but only ends up with a handful of withered husks."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The scent of these withered fragments turns rotten as their sweet fragrance disappears, leaving her having captured only the base note of their \"perfume.\""

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Emm? The smell ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "Everything is wrong here. The fog is not supposed to form at this latitude, the terrain is strange, and the plants ... they wither in an instant!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Team Member I",
    "english_dialogue": "I don't want to say this, but this place seems to be cursed."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Team Member I",
    "english_dialogue": "These phenomena make no sense. We have to go back now."
  },

  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Faced with such a bizarre situation, escape is unarguably the most rational choice."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "You heard them, Madam. What do you say? Things are indeed weird."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No, we are not returning. We have made it through the thunderstorm. What could be more dangerous than that?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Perhaps we are getting close, like those merchants said, there will be a \"price\" we must pay for the Ask and Acquire. Mr. Jurien, you also asked me about it, don't you remember?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "On the contrary, Madam, I remember it clearly. I have also told you my suspicion—it could be an exchange made between the arcanists and nature."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What? Of course not."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "Look around you—all these bizarre phenomena! You know I wasn't making things up. You set out to pursue that arcane skill, yet we ended up here ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "I don't know what your next plan is, but count me out."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Agitated by this abnormal phenomenon and talk of a possible sacrifice, the young man pushes Bessmert aside and stands with the others at the back of the group."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "A previous scene of division and opposition repeats itself."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No, I swear on my life, that is not my intention!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Madam Bessmert would never do that."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "The point is, the compass doesn't work here. You will get lost on the way back without me."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "There's no doubt this is part of your scheme."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Excuse me?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "Mr. Jurien already told us about your secret arcane skill. It's our last hope of getting home in this plight."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "We trust him. That being the case, you must come with us."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "No. I came here with Madam Bessmert. I'm not leaving without her."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei also expresses her intentions clearly. Never having been one to be swayed by external forces, unless ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Let's ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "It's fine, Madam. We can keep going on our own ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Let's go back."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "...?!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "... Unless the person she is supporting lowers her head first."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "It's alright. Though I can't see, I can imagine how shocking it must be to make you so uneasy."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "When we get back to the pastureland ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "I'm sorry, Madam. We are not taking you."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "I don't think we have enough supplies for everyone to make it back, so certainly someone must be abandoned."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei takes a step closer until she is completely blocking the depressed Bessmert's path."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Then, allow me to say no. I will not show you the way without Madam Bessmert in the team."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No, Yeni. You're going with them."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "But they are leaving you behind!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Krolik",
    "english_dialogue": "Looks like your assistant has made her own decision. Sorry, but I never thought it would end up like this ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Team Member I",
    "english_dialogue": "Enough with the talking. My apologies, ladies."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What ... What are you doing?!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "They are now facing each other, seeming to have decided to end their dispute through force."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "They are acutely aware that sacrificing one might save the many."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "It is a simple matter of arithmetic."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Standing upright is a phenomenon exclusive to humans. It is a miracle born of a desire to break free from the earth and move upward towards the sky."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The outcome unfolds quite apart from everyone's expectations."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Striped Horse?",
    "english_dialogue": "*neighs*"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I-I don't understand. What is ... What is going on?!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Even though they acknowledge the untimely nature of their dispute, they are left to witness all hope of reconciliation disintegrate before them."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei receives no answer, as the people standing in front of her now have lost the ability to reply."
