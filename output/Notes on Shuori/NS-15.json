  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I am not a striped horse, Madam. I'm a Lùshŭ! Both of them are arcane creatures, but not the same kind ... And yes, that's my arcane skill."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I can show images and diffuse sounds through water. I cast it once when we passed by the swamp in Tula, remember?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What about the \"Lùshŭ\"? What are they? Did Gĕtiān take you away and turn you into this?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "That strange term she heard before all this began suddenly reappears in her mind. Bessmert quickly associates it with her current situation."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "That rain is making too much noise. I can't hear you or the surroundings ..."

  },
  {

    "english_dialogue": "Thank you. So ... What happened? The situation is getting trickier and trickier."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "We made a mistake. Gĕtiān didn't turn me into a horse. On the contrary, he saved my life."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Then who was it? Who did this to you?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "You didn't drink any water last night, did you? But I did, quite a lot. After you went into the room, Jiŭ Niángzĭ and I had a chat downstairs, and she gave me the water."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "This is the difference. Gĕtiān said her arcane skill was cast through liquids like water and liquor."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "My poor child ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I went upstairs after the chat. You must have been too tired to notice me at the time. I stayed in the room but couldn't sleep at all, so I went downstairs again."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "That was when I heard someone singing."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "That song ... I'd never heard it before, and I had no idea what the lyrics were about. All I remember is that the melody was soft and a bit unusual."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Then I found that \"someone\" was a group of wooden dolls. They were small and would melt when they touched liquor."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei extracts the frightening journey from her mind, trying as best she can to narrate it back in a calm tone."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "And there were horses in the yard, also humming the melody. They had red manes and red tails, just like what I look like now."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I didn't know they were Lùshŭs until now. Their stripes glowed under the moon."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "But didn't you have a closer look at the Lùshŭ last night?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I had no time to see it clearly, to be honest. Anyway, that chat I had with Jiŭ Niángzĭ was ... quite good. Everything felt so comforting at the time, so I don't understand ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Then, why are you different from the animals turned from Mr. Jurien and the others? You told me they only have stripes on them, right?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes, I have an assumption about that, but I can't verify it now."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "What is it?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei falls into silent reflection for a moment before answering Bessmert."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Remember the river our team found? Perhaps that was the lower course of the main river, and it included Jiŭ Niángzĭ's arcane power because the stream across her yard is near one of its branches. The running water might have diluted the arcane power in there."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Usually, a stream of running water is like an independent settlement. It rejects outsiders by nature. Even I have been rejected more than once."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "The striped horses our teammates turned into could be an accident caused by an incomplete arcane skill."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Those other striped horses in the Zhící, are they too ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Perhaps Jiŭ Niángzĭ had no idea at all that she somehow leaked her arcane skill into the river."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "As for the water I had, she must have made it on purpose ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Both of them sink into a silence made awkward by the revelation."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "*sighs* Then, how did Gĕtiān get involved in all this?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Last night, after he saved me from the wooden dolls ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The topic of their recollections, only just resumed, is again interrupted, this time by the sudden stopping of the rain. Yenisei looks up as if to confirm it has really ended."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "If the rain has stopped for good, this also means they'll need to keep moving to avoid being found."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "The rain has stopped."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "We need to find shelter, Madam."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "No, child. I don't see why he had to take you away. What if I was there with you?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "All I know is, he was there to take us out of the danger."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "And he's injured now. When we confronted the people at the Zhící, he didn't fight back at all. I think he didn't hurt them for a reason."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "If he really meant to help us, we must go save him."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "... Child."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "All of a sudden, you seem to trust this creature entirely. Did he do anything else for you?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Based on what we know, Gĕtiān, Lǐzhèng, and Jiŭ Niángzĭ ... they all seem strange."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Please trust me, Madam. I used to think this way, too. \"Maybe he's fooling us with a fake rescue.\""
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "But he's not. He even showed me his arcane skill to win my trust. Yes, he read my bones."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "...!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Can you imagine that? He gained information by reading my bones, and then he actually told me something I didn't even know about myself."
