    "english_dialogue": "Beneath that is a deeeep canyon. Across that canyon stands the Yuān Temple. You can't see it from the other side of the bridge. It's surrounded by fog. So, I'm not sure if there really is a temple there or not."

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",

  },

    "english_dialogue": "As she takes up the ceramic cup, Yenisei is slightly surprised."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "In her mind, a material like this is one of the two extremes—crudeness and finesse, one of handmade rough bowls used by the populace, and the latter of delicate treasures owned only by the rich nobles ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yet this cup is a combination of the two extremes—it's used by an ordinary tavern owner, but it is marked by a refined, tasteful aesthetic."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "She rubs the side of the cup with her fingers, gently brushing across the painted patterns, as if feeling a fine porcelain vase."

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "The cup ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "What's wrong?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "It looks expensive."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "It's a gift I received. I don't know how much it costs, but it's delicate, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes, it is delicate."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei feels compelled to rub the surface of the ceramic cup again, as though she cannot bear to part from it, and loses herself in thought."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "The pattern is a Lùshŭ, also a kind of Xiángruì."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "See? It's majestic. The tail is like the sunset clouds. I really like it. I hope you do too."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Majestic indeed. And it looks a bit like those striped horses in the Zhící. Both of them are similar to horses."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Hmm ... but people still think they are horses. Don't they?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Sure, they do. I think this species is native to Pèi City. It's an interesting discovery and will help enrich our travel notes."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ lowers her head to look at the cup in her own hand. Yenisei can smell a fermented aroma emanating from within, like kvass, but without the sweet aroma of wheat."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "She is in bed now. I can only drink it for her."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Your drink smells good. Is this the liquor that helps one sleep tight?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Not exactly. It's just unfiltered liquor."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Sounds like you have a lot of different kinds of liquor here."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Sure, we do. There are a lot of different liquors. The unfiltered ones, the clear ones, the ones made of herbs, the fine ones ... and on and on. Bedtime liquor is made of herbs with Spine Date Seeds."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I thought liquor was just liquor. At least there aren't so many types in my hometown."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Well, to be honest, I too have no idea why they are still \"liquor,\" though they have different names."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "If the color is the standard to classify them, then what am I when I'm wearing different colored clothes? Am I not Jiŭ Niángzĭ anymore?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Haha."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Shocked, Yenisei cannot help but break into a laugh."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Seeing the other girl smile, Jiŭ Niángzĭ's eyes begin to sparkle. She nods and decides to go one step further and express her thoughts."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "That is to say, if your teammates are turned into horses or other animals in different colors, are they not your teammates anymore?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "They are, of course ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei stops talking. This childish conversation might have caused her to erupt with laughter, but the weight of the situation is still acute, and her worries swell deep within her."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The chirping of birds in the cold night gently blankets the sound of her anxious breathing."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I'm worried, actually."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Well, maybe not just worried. I don't know."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "\"Miss\" them?"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I ... I won't use this word to describe my feeling."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "All I'm thinking is, they were turned into animals because I gave them the wrong direction."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What if ... What if they can't turn back to who they really are ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The frankness of her own inquiry unmasks the long unease Yenisei had been harboring since entering this strange city."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "After speaking, she holds her breath and controls the impulse to turn back and look toward Bessmert. For a moment she is no longer even sure of where she is."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "But I don't think that will happen! Things won't get any worse."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Hmm?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "There must be a way. I promise!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Like the clouds turn colorful, pool water gets sweet like liquor ... They are many signs of auspiciousness. They just need time."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Think about it, what if the story about the Yuān Temple is real? Maybe, maybe there will be another way for you to recognize your teammates."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Even if the feather man is not a Xiángruì, there are other Xiángruìs in the city."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "All in all..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ racks her brain to find another way to persuade Yenisei, but is stopped by the other girl before she can begin."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Despite the cultural differences between the two of them, Yenisei feels a surge of warmth from her brief trembling words."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Thank you, Ms. ... No, Jiŭ Niángzĭ."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I see what you mean. I really do."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei takes a deep breath and exhales both calm emotions and words together, so that like a light white smoke they soon drift away."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Thank you."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, here are some other Spine Date seeds. Drink the water, and I'll go make you a cup of tea with the seeds. It also helps you sleep ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ shoots up to immediately rummage around in the bag beside her as she urges Yenisei to drain what is left in her cup."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei drinks down all of the cold, sweet water and hands the still-compelling cup back to her ..."
