  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",

  },

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "I-I'm not sure about that either. When I arrived at the Zhící this morning, there were already many Festive Animals in the fence."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "They're getting more and more ... How weird is that!"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ mutters inaudibly before turning around, pointing out the culprits who caused her so much trouble earlier with her index finger."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Yenisei inspects the creatures briefly but doesn't seem o notice any difference. It seems to be a show for common livestock, where various cattle, sheep, and horses might compete to show their worth."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "See, they all look alike. I can't tell which of them were brought here today. Counting is troublesome as well. I always think, \"where am I?\""
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "If only I could read and write. You write them down, then you won't miscount."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Our teammates have been turned into striped horses, like these."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Actually, we are a team of merchants. When we reached the outskirts of the city, our teammates were turned into horses and brought away by a giant bird."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Lǐzhèng said that bird was probably the feather man they've been looking for, and he appeared around the Zhící once."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "That's why we are here to ask for help."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "They're-They're not horses, I suppose."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ seems hesitant to say anything further."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "But-but how is that possible? Are you saying that the feather man can turn people into ... into horses ...?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "I don't understand. How did he get this power? Is it because he is the Xiángruì?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Upon hearing the word \"Xiángruì\" again, Bessmert's interest is immediately captured."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "We've also heard about the Xiángruì from the Storyteller. It does sound like some kind of local guardian."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Guardian? Is it the Gods of Shètí we're talking about?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, yes, the Gods of Shètí. These are the gods you serve."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "I guess Xiángruì is closer to a local legend, like a reputed arcanist in this area. The use of arcane skills seems common here. Perhaps there are also many arcanists around."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "But, could you please tell us more about the Gods of Shètí?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "There are 12 ... or 13 of them, I guess? That's all I know. I can't read most of their names."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, but I know this year is the year of Zhíxú! We will bring lots of Festive Animals to the broken bridge to worship it."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "The Fortune Walk and Bridge Leap are the most fun parts! We go to the broken bridge on the cliff with the animals, count our steps, and swing our bodies, like dancing. And at last, we will try to jump over it!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Jump over a broken bridge on the cliff? It sounds dangerous and quite ... familiar."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Bessmert knows exactly what Yenisei is hinting at. The familiar rule of \"Ask and Acquire\" resurfaces in their minds, but no one attempts to ask it out loud."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "So that Jiŭ Niángzĭ's explanation interrupts their thoughts with perfect timing."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "No, no, no, we can't do that. No one has even done that! Even the goats can't do that, let alone humans."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "We'll also cast arcane skills as safety measures to protect anyone from falling."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "The valley is deeeep down there. Once you fall down, you're not coming back."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Intriguing. And who's in charge of the safety measures, may I ask?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "The staff in the Zhící. It's the place to manage arcane affairs in the Pèi City."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "But not me ... I'm new here, filling in for the former Zhílǐ after she went back to her hometown."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "They told me to take care of Zhící for a couple of days. That's good enough for me!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Her eagerness to be able to help is clear."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "So, simply put, you're a doorkeeper?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The barb of her conclusion makes Jiŭ Niángzĭ fluster into a red blush."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "I-I'm not-I'm not just keeping the door safe! I do stuff too!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Like, um, take good care of those startled by the fire crackers! There is a kind of firecracker enhanced by arcane skill. It can make a huuuge sound! Much more louder than what you heard in the tea house!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Please forgive her. She didn't mean to hurt your feelings. We speak bluntly in the North."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, it's alright. I can tell she's a bit anxious."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "But it's not getting us anywhere. Like, um, pigs can't learn how to climb in a day ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Or, let's think another way. Can you recognize your teammates from these horses?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Let me see, there are one, wo, three ... three striped horses. Come see for yourself."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "I can't. There was little time for me to memorize the difference. Besides, even if they are my teammates, two of them are still missing."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "More than three teammates?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "When three plus two ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ counts out the numbers on her fingers, calculating with great care."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "How about we wait and see what Lǐzhèng has found out?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "That's right, child, didn't Lǐzhèng leave us with a letter?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh, right. I almost forgot. Please read this, Ms. Jiŭ Niángzĭ. It may have clues about the feather man."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "She produces the letter, offering it to the girl."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ opens it in front of them without a moment's hesitation, but all Yenisei can see on it are several images."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Um ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Make the fence taller ... Get off work earlier and ... go back to the tavern?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "What is he trying to say?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "What do these have to do with the feather man?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Hmm?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ mutters to herself as she stares at the pictures on the letter, before frowning and smoothing it out. She clumsily folds it and clips it to her waist."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Well, don't worry! I'll pay close attention to the new horses for you!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "If there's any good news, I'll ask Lǐzhèng to tell you."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "You're so kind. But we first just got here and haven't decided where to stay for the night. How are we going to keep Lǐzhèng informed once we find a place to rest?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Oh ... I see ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "An answer leaps to her mind, bursting through and out at the same time."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "How about staying in my tavern? I forgot to tell you that I'm the owner of a tavern."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "And I'm doing it well!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "She laughs, as though just the saying of it might render it true."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "It is located in the merchants hub, two streets away from the Zhící. Lǐzhèng will know your whereabouts since he's in charge of the hub."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "I'll take you back to the tavern, also escort these animals back to the Zhící. You can check out other animals there as well!"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Good idea."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "That'd be great. Saves us from the trouble sleeping on the streets."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Let's go then. Oh, the streets looks beautiful later in the night. You can't miss the golden lanterns and bonfires lit on Dùshuò Festival! They light up the sky and the street as if it's daytime."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Everything seems brighter at night."
