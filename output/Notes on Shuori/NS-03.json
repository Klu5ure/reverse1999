    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "Now, it's time for us to set out again for the Eastern arcane skill you mentioned."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "But before we do that ... I remember you once mentioned your assistant during your speech, saying her arcane skill was related to water and could find directions in the wild."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Yes, you remember it correctly."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "Ah, that is so wonderful! Earlier, you said that this was a safeguard, but at the time you did not explain in detail how it would work ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "Now, may I have the honor to witness it? How does she communicate with water? Will she be possessed?"

    "english_speaker": "Jurien",
    "english_dialogue": "Or like those mystics in the Palace ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Sir, my arcane skill cannot predict what will happen precisely, and it is not cast through \"possession.\""
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "Please do not overestimate what you don't understand and simply count on it."
  },
  {

    "english_dialogue": "I know, child. I'm only curious and hoping to see it with my own eyes ..."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "No, Sir. It is not an exhibit in the museum or a play in the theater."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "There's little you can do even if you go there, given the condition of your eyes. I will go check them, one by one."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_dialogue": "Wait. Mr. Jurien jus asked about your arcane power. Maybe now it's a good time."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_dialogue": "What?"
  },

    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
