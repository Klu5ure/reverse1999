  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "No. It was a Daoist I traveled with before I came to Pèi City. The Daoist said many different things over and over again. I couldn't understand, but I remembered them."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Sounds like you had a distinguished teacher. Since you came here, you've been treating people nice and kindly, exactly the opposite of what Gĕtiān has done."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Ah, so his name is Gĕtiān."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",

    "english_dialogue": "Her head lowers, seeming to find it difficult to accept such a change in thought."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Because you're the Zhílǐ."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "Jiŭ Niángzĭ looks at Lǐzhèng, her face caught between doubt and curiosity."
  },

    "english_dialogue": "The former Zhílǐ left because of what he said and did. Now he wants to play the same trick on you."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "What's more, when he got here and saw me but not you, he acted quite surprise. You can tell from the details."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Jiu Niangzi",
    "english_dialogue": "Hmm ..."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",

  },

    "english_dialogue": "What if I can go to the Yuān Temple and ask Zhíxú the Guardian?"
  },

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "I guess so."
  },

    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_dialogue": "The wo of them walk indoors, their conversation disappearing from the courtyard under the sound of footsteps on hard stone."

  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "That is the whole story. Gĕtiān is now detained in Zhící's dungeon. Jiŭ Niángzĭ is there as well."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Four hours ago, after discussing with the new Zhílǐ, we decided to keep the ceremonies of Fortune Walk and Bridge Leap."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "But no colored animals are used this time. The number of animals will be less than those in previous years of Zhíxú."

    "english_dialogue": "One more thing. Have we found the horse and the proof?"
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "Lizheng",
    "english_dialogue": "Not yet. The horse taking that foreign lady away might still be under the control of Gĕtiān. There was no trace of them when our people chased them out of the city."
  },
  {
    "english_speaker": "???",
    "english_dialogue": "I understand, given he road conditions in the morning rain. Looks like we will have to continue with the search after it stops."
  },
